   Pink Floyd is my all time favorite.  I wish I had taken the time, and justified the expense when I had the chance to see them perform.  
   From the release of Dark Side of the Moon in 1973, I was hooked.  I wore out many copies driving to nowhere just listening.  Being lost in the theatrical
   and instrumental accompanied me on many adventures.  My close friends knew and surprised me with their music as gifts just because.  There's that SMILE, as
   I listen and think back.

   Music was a big part of our social gatherings and there was always some type of music coming out of our homes and cars whenever we were together.
   Today, whenever I choose an album, or tune in to KSHE&#8209;95, there's that SMILE as I remember the faces of my friends together just listening.  We didn't need a
   reason to be together, we just were.  We didn't let the busy of life get in our way.  Being together was our life and our music played a big part.  Many times
   we would drop everything and pile into the car to rush to some venue that had some band we just had to see.  Drop everything and rush over to the radio station
   to get a glimpse of a lead singer of some band playing at the Checkerdome that night. Standing in line or camping out to get the latest release and the best seat to a show.
   Don't forget to buy the shirt to wear the next day, so everyone knew you went!  There's that SMILE.

   We could not wait to get paid, we made our trips to Peaches Records & Tapes to get the new album or two.  Don't forget the crate to stack in order to
   have space to hold the new addition(s) to your collection.  They make nice end tables to hold the lava lamps, ashtrays, and beercan collections too!  First apartment
   furnishings were a must.  Another SMILE.

	Music introduced new freinds as our families grew bigger.  Bands played in the basement and there was always room for more.  Out of town guests had a 
	place to stay as they traveled through to their next destination.  Your family member was our aunt, our grandma, and our mom and dads too. And when they visited we 
	all were better people because of who they were.  There's that SMILE.

   Some have passed too soon, yet when I hear a tune from their favorite I remember the fun we had together.  That memory of them playing the air guitar
   or dancing just because, there's that SMILE.  I remember where we were when we first heard that song and witnessed their rush to turn it up to make sure everyone in the
   neigborhood did not miss a beat.

   <h2>Thanks to the music, THERE'S THAT SMILE.</h2>
